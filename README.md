# IAI Forex Software ReadMe

This ReadMe file provides an explanation of the code for the IAI Forex Software. Please note that Forex Robot Easy Team is not the official developer of this product. We are only showcasing a sample code that can work as described in the product. To find the official developer of this product, please refer to MQL5.

## Code Explanation

The IAI Forex Software utilizes the MetaTrader 5 platform to implement a trading strategy based on Bollinger Bands deviation. The code consists of several functions and a main algorithm for executing trades and monitoring profitability.

### Expert initialization function - OnInit()
This function is called during the initialization of the Expert Advisor. It includes any necessary initialization code and should return `INIT_SUCCEEDED` if successful.

### Expert deinitialization function - OnDeinit(const int reason)
This function is called when the Expert Advisor is being shut down. It includes any necessary deinitialization code.

### Expert tick function - OnTick()
This is the main function where the trading logic is implemented. It is called on each tick of the market. The code identifies entry points based on the deviation of Bollinger Bands. If the current price is above the upper band plus 3 times the deviation, a buy trade is executed. If the price is below the lower band minus 3 times the deviation, a sell trade is executed.

### Monitoring and adjusting trades
After executing trades, the code enters a loop to monitor and adjust the trades to maximize profitability. It iterates through all open orders and checks if they belong to the current symbol and have the magic number 3. If a trade meets these conditions, it checks if it has reached a certain profit target. If the profit is greater than 10, the trade is closed. Additionally, the code adjusts the stop loss and take profit levels based on market conditions.

### Expert start function - OnStart()
This function is called when the Expert Advisor starts processing. It can be used for any additional processing that needs to be done.
